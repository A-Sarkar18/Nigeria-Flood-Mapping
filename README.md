# Nigeria Flood Mapping
Satellite Products capturing Nigeria's 2022 Flooding events from GEE

## Project Description
For this brief excersise, I wanted to apply the NDWI methodlogy for pixel classification introduced by McFeeters in 1996 to map flooding using MODIS satellite imagery. By using Google Earth Engine, I was able to access MODIS satellite products. The 2022 Nigeria Floods were some of the most devastating in recent history.
